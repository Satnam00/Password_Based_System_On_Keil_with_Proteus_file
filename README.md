As we know technology is developing day by day.
Every where we see remote  operated devices are replacing the ordinary switching/ controlling methods.
It also proves itself  a very cheap and effective way to control the devices, but when we see our rooms or our houses  we are still using the ordinary methods of switching to control all the home appliances.
So we developed the RC5 protocol based device which can easily replace the ordinary switching board. 
Which works on Manchester coding and this device enables us cotrolling our devices conviently.
